                <b>Some history about us:</b>The founders of this store company are Bob Wilson and Charles Bennicky. We opened out first store on O' Connell steet back in 2015, where we were met with high demand for our products so slowly but surely more and more stores opened since then. We have over 220 staff members placed throughout these stores, and can attest to their amazing customer handling, expertise and work professionalism. We hope you look forward to visiting our stores and know we will be seeing you again in the future. Until then best of wishes from all our staff at Super School Supply.
